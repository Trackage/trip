# Tools for animal track data

The trip package provides functions for accessing and manipulating
spatial data for animal tracking.  Filter for speed and create time
spent plots from animal track data.


## Installing

The package is easily installed from CRAN in R. 

```R
install.packages("trip")
```

## Install dev version

To install the development package from Github, use `devtools`: 

```R
devtools::install_github("mdsumner/trip")
```



## TODO

- **Probability image**.  The SGAT (and tripEstimation) packages have
functions for dealing with spatial track summaries that are
atomized to the level of each time step. There are methods for combining summaries from
multiple tracks and for casting arbitrary durations (by sum) to standard image structures. This would be a good
feature to replace the existing tripGrid function by storing the 
individual grid summaries for each implicit line segment.

- **Coercion to/from other classes** The crawl and move packages contain objects that 
could be coerced in a straightforward way, see the Spatio Temporal Task View for 
more (in the Moving Objects / Trajectories section). The hyperframe in spatstat is another example, and to follow up Edzer's work in spacetime. 

- **Validation** Must include a detailed report object of where the problems are, and how to filter/fix/flush them.
