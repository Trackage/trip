# Tools for animal track data

The trip package provides functions for accessing and manipulating
spatial data for animal tracking.  Filter for speed and create time
spent plots from animal track data.

# Development

There is some ongoing integration with the `sf` package, mostly to provide outputs in its
formats. Trip itself would be better implemented on top of the ideas in https://github.com/r-gris/rangl/, rather than shoe-horned into a weird twilight zone between MULTIPOINTs and LINESTRINGs as it is now. 

## Installing

The package is easily installed from CRAN in R. 

```R
install.packages("trip")
```

## Install dev version

To install the development package from Github, use `devtools`: 

```R
devtools::install_github("mdsumner/trip")
```



## TODO

- **Probability image**.  The SGAT (and tripEstimation) packages have
functions for dealing with spatial track summaries that are
atomized to the level of each time step. There are methods for combining summaries from
multiple tracks and for casting arbitrary durations (by sum) to standard image structures. This would be a good
feature to replace the existing tripGrid function by storing the 
individual grid summaries for each implicit line segment.

- **Coercion to/from other classes** See [spbabel](https://github.com/mdsumner/spbabel). 

- **Validation** Must include a detailed report object of where the problems are, and how to filter/fix/flush them.
