	CHANGES IN trip VERSION 1.1-15

OVERVIEW
	
   o modification to to summary.trip to give summaries of distance, speed

	CHANGES IN trip VERSION 1.1-14

   o much of the source was overhauled and tidied up

   o cut.trip added to replace old function trip.split.exact which is deprecated

   (generic from sp)


        CHANGES IN trip VERSION 1.1-12

   o fix for ltraj2trip


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
	
   o Thanks to Sebastian Luque for ltraj2trip patch


        CHANGES IN trip VERSION 1.1-12

   o reduced time taken by examples by removal with dontrun, thanks
	to CRAN maintainers


        CHANGES IN trip VERSION 1.1-11

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

   o Thanks to Sebastian Luque for advice on NAMESPACE fixes

   o thanks to Andrew Irwin for update on trackDistance documentation


OVERVIEW

   o added a NAMESPACE file and package updates to make everything
   work, maptools is now Imports, rgdal, adehabitatLT and lattice are
   Suggests
	
   o modified dependency on adehabitat to adehabitatLT

   o removed class definitions for ppp, psp and owin, now imported
   from maptools

   o update to trackDistance documentation


        CHANGES IN trip VERSION 1.1-10

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

        o Suppressed warnings from owin for duplicate points used in
        pixellate/tripGrid.

	o spatstat is now required, not just suggested.

BUG FIXES

	o superimpose used rather than deprecated superimposePSP

        o consistency for S3 generic / method arguments in as.ppp.trip
        and as.psp.trip

        o fixed incomplete "[" method documentation for trip


	CHANGES IN trip VERSION 1.1-9

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	o speed improvement in speedfilter, 6x or more


	CHANGES IN trip VERSION 1.1-8

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

	 o Thanks to Sebastian Luque for pointing out a problem with
	 zero-length lines.

	 o Thanks to Francois Rousseu for bug report in readDiag.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

 	o new function filter.penSS to provide non-destructive filter
	for track data.

	o colours for plotting lines(trip) has been updated, with
	smarter defaults and leveraging new capacity in sp for passing
	in lwd/lty/col etc.

	o trackDistance has been completely replaced as a wrapper to
	an R-level gcdist. This can provide a roughly 3x speed-up for
	running trackDistance and speedfilter.

	o Removed "push" argument from trackDistance.

	o New as.ppp and as.psp methods to convert from trip to
	spatstat's point and line classes.

	o New as(trip, "SpatialLinesDataFrame") method to convert to
	sp lines.

        o spTransform method for trip objects.

	o trip now Suggests rgdal for spTransform use.

	o new as.ltraj.trip methods for ltraj class in adehabitat

	o trip now Suggests adehabitat for coercion to ltraj

 BUG FIXES

	o readDiag would fail when no invalid records were present.

	o Zero-length lines would propagate NaNs to the entire
	tripGrid for method "density" (fixed by spatstat > 1.19-1).


	CHANGES IN trip VERSION 1.1-6

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS


	 o Thanks to Adrian Baddeley for updates to pixellate.psp in
	 spatstat 1.18-3 and 1.18-4.

	 o Thanks to Edzer Pebesma for updates to the CVS development
	 version of sp, methods for split and SpatialPixelsDataFrame.


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES



	o New function trip.split.exact to cut trip events at specific
	time-based boundaries.

	o Added method argument, including density and pixellate to
	 tripGrid, using density.psp and pixellate.psp.


	 o trip.R: updated tripGrid, replaced old interpolation
	approximation with spatstat exact line/cross/cell logic
	(pixellate.psp). Zero length line segments are supported by
	trip, and their contribution is recorded by point in cell
	measurement.  tripGrid.interp still exists for the old
	approach, and kde method.

	o added verbose argument to readArgos to suppress reporting of
	duplicate time modifications.

	o added summary of trip duration total to print.summary.tordata.

BUG FIXES
	o improvements to makeGridTopology which would sometimes give a silly result

	o removed boilerplate tags in many Rd files

	o removed unused \dots argument in speedfilter

	o trip.R: validtordata required the ID component of a trip to
	be numeric or factor. This now allows character.

	o trip.R: updated setMethod("[", "trip" to use same argument
	handling as SpatialPointsDataFrame

	o Fixed harmless warning error in readArgos for longitudes > 180.


	CHANGES IN trip VERSION 1.1-4

	o trip.R: removed setReplaceMethod required by r50609 in R-devel.
