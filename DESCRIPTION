Description: Functions for accessing and manipulating spatial data for animal
    tracking, with straightforward coercion from and to other formats. Filter
    for speed and create time spent maps from animal track data. There are
    coercion methods to convert between 'trip' and 'ltraj' from 'adehabitatLT', 
    and between 'trip' and 'psp' and 'ppp' from 'spatstat'. Trip objects
    can be created from raw or grouped data frames, and from types in the 'sp', 
    'sf', 'amt', 'trackeR', 'mousetrap', and other packages.
